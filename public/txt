Build a simple inventory management app using React.js. The app should display a table of items in stock and allow users to:

1. Add new items to the inventory.
2. Edit and delete existing items.
3. Filter the table by item category.
4. Sort items by quantity.
5. Highlight low-stock items (e.g., quantity below 10).
